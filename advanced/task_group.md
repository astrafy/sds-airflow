# Grouping Tasks with TaskGroup in Airflow

Airflow's TaskGroup is a feature that allows you to organize multiple tasks into a group, making your DAGs more 
structured and visually simplified. TaskGroups help in managing execution dependencies and relationships within a DAG.

## Benefits of Using TaskGroup

- **Improved Organization:** Clusters related tasks, making the DAG easier to manage and understand.
- **Enhanced UI:** Reduces clutter in the Airflow UI by grouping tasks under a single collapsible element.
- **Scoped Configuration:** Allows for setting default arguments for all tasks within the group.

## Example of TaskGroup
Here's how you can define a **TaskGroup** in your DAG:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup

with DAG(
    dag_id='example_taskgroup',
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval="@daily"
) as dag:

    start = DummyOperator(task_id='start')

    with TaskGroup(group_id='processing_tasks') as processing_tasks:
        task1 = DummyOperator(task_id='task1')
        task2 = DummyOperator(task_id='task2')

    end = DummyOperator(task_id='end')

    start >> processing_tasks >> end
```

This structure simplifies complex workflows, especially those involving numerous tasks with shared dependencies.
